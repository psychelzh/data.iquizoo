* Removed one game for there will be no data storage for it.
* Added preprocessing function name to several newly added games.

# data.iquizoo 2023.02.27

* Changed version to `YYYY.MM.DD` format. This will make the version number more informative about the release date.
* Added more recently developed games.

# data.iquizoo 0.3.1

* Changed version name to `game_name_ver`.

# data.iquizoo 0.3.0

* Support `VersionName` update with a new column named `"version_name"` in `game_info` table.

# data.iquizoo 0.2.1

* Added more games.

# data.iquizoo 0.2.0

## Breaking Changes

* Changed `game_id` class to `bit64::integer64`. This is the default class of the values fetched from database for these values.

## Misc

* Updated `game_info` to the newest version.

# data.iquizoo 0.1.2

* Update `prep_fun_name` for two games: RAPM and AntiSac.
